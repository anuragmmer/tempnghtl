                <p>This article explains the workings of the BIS, Bureau of Indian Standards, and its standard formulation procedures.</p>
                
                <p>While reading about the history of manufacturing, I stumbled upon DIN 8580, a framework for classifying manufacturing processes. DIN stands for Deutsches Institut für Normung, which is the German Institute for Standardization.</p>
                
                <p>This is where I have tried to compile the basics of standardization with respect to BIS. The What, How & Why of the invisible backbone of modern civilization.</p>

                </div>
                    
                <h2>Standardization and BIS</h2>


                <p>Standardization is a way to introduce the optimum degree of order in products, services, and processes across industries. It’s a set of rules that ensures consistency, safety, and efficiency. These rules are often adopted legally to protect public welfare. For example, BIS mandates ISI marks for drinking water pipes (IS 4985) to prevent contamination.</p>

                <p>The erstwhile Indian Standards Institution (ISI) was established in the year 1947. After independence, India focused on industrialization and setting up institutions to regulate quality. India needed to develop its industries and ensure products met certain standards for both domestic use and export, and we didn’t want to use British Standard which was in place prior to 1947.</p>

                <p>The Indian Standards Institution (ISI) was later renamed the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) on April 1, 1987. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act of 1986 established the BIS as the National Standards Body of India. The BIS Act of 1986 came into effect on December 23, 1986, and the BIS came into existence, with a broadened scope and more powers.</p>

                <h2>Aim of Standardization</h2>

                <p>BIS and similar organizations worldwide develop technical standards, certify compliance with safety and quality norms, enforce purity and safety regulations, and enhance trade efficiency by aligning with international standard bodies. These organizations ensure that everything from your smartphone charger (BIS-certified) to the paper you print on (DIN-standardized) works safely, efficiently, and reliably.</p>

                <p>Standardizations are established for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Provision of means of communication:</b> Create a "common language" for industries.</li>
                    <li><b>Promotion of economy:</b> Avoid waste in production and logistics.</li>
                    <li><b>Protection of consumer interests:</b> Ensure products/services are safe and reliable.</li>
                    <li><b>Promotion of the quality:</b> Improve the quality of life and protect the planet.</li>
                    <li><b>Promotion of trade:</b> Remove technical "walls" between countries.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How BIS Works</h2>

                <p>BIS functions through a hierarchical committee system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Standards Advisory Committee (SAC):</b> This is the apex body advising on policy, harmonizing standards, and overseeing Division Councils.</li>
                    <li><b>Division Councils:</b> They establish Sectional Committees, define scopes, and approve new standards for specific sectors (e.g., Electronics, Textiles).</li>
                    <li><b>Sectional Committees (SCs):</b> Technical committees consisting of stakeholders (manufacturers, consumers, regulators, experts) that draft standards.</li>
                    <li><b>Sub-committees/Panels:</b> Focus on specialized tasks or time-bound projects under SCs.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>BIS is a member of the "Code of Good Practice for the preparation, adoption, and application of standards" (Article 4 of the TBT Agreement, Annex 3), which mandates harmonization with ISO/IEC standards unless justified by national security, health, or environmental needs and adjusts its procedures for creating standards to follow this code.</p>

                <p>This means BIS adopts ISO/IEC standards where appropriate and participates in ISO/IEC committees as a P-member (active voter) or O-member (observer) in over 90% of ISO’s technical committees, influencing global standards.</p>
                
            

                <p>This adaptation has three routes (as per IS 12:2004 and ISO/IEC Guide 21):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Identical Adoption (IDT):</b> Direct adoption without changes (e.g., IS/ISO 9001 for Quality Management).</li>
                    <li><b>Modified Adoption (MOD):</b> Technical deviations for local needs (e.g., climatic conditions, safety regulations).</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Adoption:</b> Rejects ISO standards if incompatible with Indian priorities.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Stages of Development</h2>

                <p>Indian Standards are developed/reviewed based on a project approach by a technical committee or sub-committee within the organization:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Proposal Stage:</b> Proposals originate from government bodies, industry associations, or experts. Evaluated by SCs and approved by Division Councils based on national need, feasibility, and stakeholder consensus. Prioritized as Priority I (urgent, 12-month timeline) or Priority II (24-month timeline).</li>
                    <li><b>Preparatory Stage:</b> Working Draft (WD) prepared, often involving external experts or outsourcing.</li>
                    <li><b>Committee Stage:</b> Draft circulated as Preliminary Draft (P-Draft) for internal committee feedback. Consensus-driven revisions (not unanimity).</li>
                    <li><b>Approval Stage:</b> Wide Circulation Draft (WC) released for public comment (minimum 1 month). Comments reviewed, and final draft approved by SC and Division Council.</li>
                    <li><b>Publication Stage:</b> Final standard notified in the Gazette of India and published with an IS number. Alignment with ISO/IEC standards may result in dual-numbered standards (e.g., IS/ISO 9001).</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Stages and Process of Revision of Indian Standards</h2>

                <p>The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) follows a systematic process even for revising standards to maintain relevancy with technological advancements, regulatory changes, and international practices.</p>

                <p>Every Indian Standard is reviewed every 5 years or every 3 years for standards in fast-evolving sectors like electronics and telecommunications. The review helps BIS determine whether a standard should be reaffirmed, revised, amended, or withdrawn.</p>

                <p>Reviews can be triggered by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Technological advancements (e.g., new materials, processes).</li>
                    <li>Changes in international standards (e.g., ISO/IEC updates).</li>
                    <li>Regulatory or safety requirements (e.g., new environmental laws).</li>
                    <li>Stakeholder feedback (e.g., industry, consumers, testing labs).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Various sectors are categorized into High-Revision and Low-Revision sectors to determine the frequency of revision:</p>

                <h3>High-Revision Sectors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Electronics and IT:</b> Standards are revised frequently (every 2–3 years) due to rapid technological changes (e.g., 5G, IoT).</li>
                    <li><b>Food Safety:</b> Revised to align with global standards (e.g., ISO 22000) or address new contaminants (e.g., pesticide residues).</li>
                    <li><b>Automotive:</b> Updated to meet emission norms (e.g., Bharat Stage VI) or safety regulations (e.g., crash testing).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Low-Revision Sectors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Traditional Industries:</b> Standards for products like handlooms or ceramics may remain unchanged for decades unless significant changes occur.</li>
                    <li><b>Basic Materials:</b> Standards for cement (IS 269) or steel (IS 2062) are revised only when new testing methods or material compositions emerge.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Sectors where Indian Standards have been set up</h2>

                <p>As of 1 January 2019, we have over 20,000 Standards. These cover important segments of the economy which include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chemicals</li>
                    <li>Food and Agriculture</li>
                    <li>Civil</li>
                    <li>Electro-technical</li>
                    <li>Electronics & Information Technology</li>
                    <li>Mechanical Engineering</li>

                    <li>Metallurgical Engineering</li>
                    <li>Petroleum Coal & Related Products</li>
                    <li>Medical Equipment and Hospital Planning</li>
                    <li>Textile</li>
                    <li>Transport Engineering</li>
                    <li>Production & General Engineering</li>
                    <li>Water Resources</li>
                </ul>
